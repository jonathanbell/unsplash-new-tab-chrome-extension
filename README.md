# Unsplash New Tab

A Chrome extension that shows Unsplash photos on each new tab. Can be configured to show your own Unsplash photos, your likes, or random photos from across Unsplash.

## Development notes

To get started developing:

1. If you don't already have it, install ESLint globally. _`npm` wasn't used for development because it felt too heavy-handed. This extension is meant to be lightweight._
1. Clone this repository
1. [Load the extension "unpacked" into Chrome.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)

If you'd like to check your JS for issues/bugs, run ESLint via: `eslint --ext .js .`
