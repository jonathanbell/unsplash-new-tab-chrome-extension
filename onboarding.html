      Unsplash New Tab
    </h1>
    <p>
      By default, the extension will show random images from
      <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>
      when you open a new tab.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to show your own Unsplash photos or your liked photos from
      Unsplash (instead of random images), open the extension's options by
      clicking the 3 dots next to the extension's name in the Chrome extensions
      menu. Alternatively, you can pin the extension to the Chrome toolbar and
      right-click on the extension's icon and choose "Options". Enter your
      Unsplash username (or the Unsplash username of someone you admire ðŸ˜») and
      choose the content you want to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time you open a new tab after installing the extension or
      changing the extension options, it will take a few moments for a new photo
      to load. However, subsequent new tabs will load much faster. If the new
      options don't seem to be immediately effective, open some new tabs. This
      action will also trigger a cache rebuild, which should then display the
      newly chosen content on new tabs.
